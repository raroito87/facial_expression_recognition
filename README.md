# facial_expression_recognition
Final project. Facial expression classifier.

# Description
The project takes a data set provided by Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/

The goal is to determine anyone's emotional state by taking a picture (using the laptop's Webcam for example). This will be achieve by building an image classification system in which face pictures are analyzed and categorized accoring to their facial expression.

# Motivation

Facial expression recognition is not a new topic. Neverthedless it doesnt make it less interesting. Developing a model that can read a face and properly determine the emotion behind it sounds quite exciting for someone like me who just enter the whole of Machine Learning and that is why I choose this as the topic for my first big project.
