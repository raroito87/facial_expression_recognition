# facial_expression_recognition
Final project. Facial expression classifier.

# Description
The project takes a data set provided by Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/

The goal is to determine anypne's emotional state by taking a picture (using the laptop's Webcam for example).

# Motivation

Facial expression recognition is not a new topic. Neverthedless it doesnt make it less interesting. Developing a model that can read a face and properly determine the emotion behind it sounds quite exciting for someone like me who just enter the whole of Machine Learning and that is why I choose this as the topic for my first big project.

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raroito87/facial_expression_recognition/
```

```sh
conda env create --file environment.yml
source activate my_voice_predictor
```

## Usage
